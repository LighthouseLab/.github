# Lighthouse Lab

We are a proud community of developers and innovators driven by the passion for knowledge sharing. Our goal is to build software solutions that are not just premium and efficient but available to everyone for free.

## üî• About us

At Lighthouse Lab, we build free (libre) and open-source software, believing that software, knowledge and resources should be accessible to everyone, anywhere.

We run on a sponsorship-based income model - this means that users who can and are willing to pay for our software are free to do so. It's the principle of free choice that we vitally uphold and respect.

## üåê A Global Team of Software Engineers

We are home to a global team with a diverse ethnic and cultural background. Our team comprises individuals with distinct specializations - Front-end, Back-end, DevOps, Security, etc., working across a wide range of tech stacks. Leveraging the potential of a global team, we provide a great work‚Äîlife balance as everyone works from anywhere, fostering the culture of worldwide collaboration.

## üåé Equal Opportunity Employer

We are an equal opportunity employer. We believe that diversity in our team is our strength. We welcome everyone, irrespective of their race, color, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical abilities, or religious beliefs.

## üí° Our Policy

Transparency is the key. We implement a 100% transparent policy, not just when it comes to our code but also our finances. We ensure that our contribution to the world of software is unprecedented, documented, and open for improvement. All project management is done in a public and transparent way and we glorify the concept of equal pay, by dividing the sponsorship money equally among all team members.

## ‚ú® Our Impact

Our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint is unwavering. By allowing our team members to work from wherever they are, we not only provide a flexible work environment but also eliminate the need for physical offices, eliminating daily commutes and thus, contribute to the betterment of our planet. Additionally, this also helps us to keep our operational costs in check, ensuring our resources are rightfully directed towards our tech endeavours.
